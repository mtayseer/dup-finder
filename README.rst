Purpose
=======

Given a directory, scans all the files & print all the duplicates.

For me, this serves few more

1. Fun: I was bored so I made this for fun.
2. Learning Python optimization, git, and later, I will add a beautiful Tkinter UI to it.

This is available to everyone. Fork it & play with it. You are responsible for using it.
